**How are production and interpretation related in pronoun processing?**

Tradition views in pronoun processing usually seem production and interpretation as the mirror images of each other. However, recent research has suggested that the two processes are not guided by the same set of factors, and therefore proposed a Bayesian approach to account for their relationship. My research investigated the validity of the new model in Chinese with new contexts. Apart from overt pronouns like English *s/he,* Mandarin also allows an unpronounced null pronoun (e.g., Ada received a letter, so Ã˜ wrote a reply). Although the interpretation of overt pronouns can be well predicted by the Bayesian Model, the interpretation of null pronouns was not, and neither of the existing models was able to capture it. I am still working on this topic to see how this relationship differs in null pronouns and overt pronouns.

**What determines the production of pronouns?**

The use of pronouns has been long argued to be associated with a concept 'accessibility'. The more accessible the referent is, the more reduced forms will be used for it. Earlier research recognized accessibility as 'topicality', i.e., how likely the current topic can continue. Considering the difficulty to identify topicality, recent work also suggested it as 'predictability', i.e., how likely a referent will be the next referent. Our research suggested that neither topicality nor predictability acts as the unified scale of accessibility. Rather, we provided evidence to a multiple factor approach that referential expressions are guided by form-specific constraints. For example, in Mandarin, whereas both overt and null pronouns were constrained by grammatical role, only null pronouns were insensitive to semantic factors and topicality.

**Double Object Constructions in Cantonese**

There are three ditransitives in Cantonese, including a double object construction (DOC), i.e., *I give you a book* in English. Previous research mainly took a lexical semantics approach to categorize the meaning of the three constructions. I observed two facts contrasting with the current analysis: First, although verb types allowed in each construction differ, the difference was in the construction semantics but not lexical meaning; second, the syntactic structure of the DOCs varies in lexical semantics. My work provided a novel semantic categorization based on constructions a syntactic analysis. I argued that DOC is just carrying a further sense of transfer than other ditransitives, and proposed that there are at least two kinds of DOCs.
