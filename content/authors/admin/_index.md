Hi! My name is Suet-Ying Lam. I am currently a senior undergraduate from HKU, with double majors in Linguistics and Computer Science. I am currently working with [Dr. Heeju Hwang](https://sites.google.com/site/heejuhwang/home?authuser=0) at HKU Language Processing Lab, focusing on the following questions: 

1. How are production and interpretation related in pronoun processing?

   Tradition views in pronoun processing usually seem production and interpretation as the mirror images of each other. However, recent research has suggested that the two processes are not guided by the same set of factors, and therefore proposed a Bayesian approach to account for their relationship. My research investigated the validity of the new model in Chinese with new contexts. Apart from overt pronouns like English *s/he,* Mandarin also allows an unpronounced null pronoun (e.g., Ada received a letter, so Ø wrote a reply). Although the interpretation of overt pronouns can be well predicted by the Bayesian Model, the interpretation of null pronouns was not, and neither of the existing models was able to capture it. I am still working on this topic to see how this relationship differs in null pronouns and overt pronouns.

   * Lam, S.-Y. & Hwang, H. (2021). Interpretation of null pronouns in Mandarin Chinese does not follow a Bayesian model. Short talk presented at the 34th Annual CUNY conference on Human Sentence Processing. [[Abstract](https://www.cuny2021.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CUNY_2021_abstract_126.pdf)]
2. What determines the production of pronouns?

   Earlier research recognized accessibility as 'topicality', i.e., how likely the current topic can continue. Considering the difficulty to identify topicality, recent work also suggested it as 'predictability', i.e., how likely a referent will be the next referent. Our research suggested that neither topicality nor predictability acts as the unified scale of accessibility. Rather, we provided evidence to a multiple factor approach that referential expressions are guided by form-specific constraints. For example, in Mandarin, the use of overt pronouns and null pronouns was constrained by different sets of factors. Whereas both of them were constrained by grammatical role, overt pronouns were insensitive to semantic factors and topicality, which influence the use of null pronouns.

I am also supervised by Prof. Stephen Matthews to investigate the semantics and syntax of Cantonese double object constructions. 

**About how to pronounce my name:** it can be roughly transcribed as \[syʔ yɪŋ], or in Mandarin \[ɕuə yiŋ]. If you still find it difficult, \[yɪŋ] or \[yiŋ] is also fine.
