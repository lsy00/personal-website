Hi! My name is Suet-Ying Lam. I am currently a senior undergraduate from HKU, with double majors in Linguistics and Computer Science. I am  working with [Dr. Heeju Hwang](https://sites.google.com/site/heejuhwang/home?authuser=0) at HKU Language Processing Lab, with interests in two questions: 

1.  How are production and interpretation related in pronoun processing? 
2. What determines the production of pronouns?

Apart from pronoun processing, I am also supervised by Prof. Stephen Matthews to investigate the semantics and syntax of Cantonese double object constructions. 

You may find more details of my research projects in the Project tab.

**About how to pronounce my name:** it can be roughly transcribed as \[syʔ yɪŋ], or in Mandarin \[ɕuə yiŋ]. If you still find it difficult, \[yɪŋ] or \[yiŋ] is also fine.
